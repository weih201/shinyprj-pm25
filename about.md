### Welcome to PM25 emission explorer
This app is to show the PM25 emission across the United States. 

The data set is based on Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project's [PM2.5 Emissions Data Set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip). 

The original data set contains the PM2.5 emissions data of 1999, 2002, 2005,and 2008 years. To reduce data size, this app just used the 2005 and 2008 years' data. 


You can check the PM2.5 emission based on source type and years across US or a specific state:

 * To check emission in specific years, click the years radio Button
 * To show the emission from a specific soure, click the type radio button
 * To check emission in a state, select state name from State Name select box
